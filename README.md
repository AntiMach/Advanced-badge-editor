# Advanced badge editor
An advanced 3DS Badge Editor

## Features
This app lets you edit your BadgeData.dat and BadgeMngFile.dat files with ease!  
Make sure that both files are in the same directory when openning them with the editor.

Create your own badges and sets easily, by clicking a button and importing a PNG image!
You can also import badge data from *.prb files and set data from *.cab files.
