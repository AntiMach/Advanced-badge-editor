# Advanced-badge-editor
An advanced 3DS Badge Editor

## Features
This thing lets you edit your BadgeData.dat and BadgeMngFile.dat files with ease!  
Make sure that both files are in the same directory when openning them with the editor.

Create your own badge easily, by clicking a button and importing a PNG image!
You can also use an archaically old method that takes 4 different files, but I wouldn't recommend doing it =|

Creating a set is identical to creating a badge, but it only requires one image.
