# Advanced-badge-editor
An advanced 3DS Badge Editor

## Features
This thing lets you edit your BadgeData.dat and BadgeMngFile.dat files with ease!  
Make sure that both files are in the same directory when openning them with the editor.

Create your own badge easily, by clicking a button and importing some BCLIM files!  
A badge has 2 different parts (image and shape) and 2 different sizes for each part!  
To make those images, you can use png2bclim by Kaphotics, or my modded version that fixes tonnes of problems the other version had.  
PNG2BCLIM: https://github.com/TheMachinumps/png2bclim/releases

Creating a set is identical to creating a badge, but it only requires one image.
